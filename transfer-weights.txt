Transfer Weights

Two containers are provided, one of which can store x kilograms  of pulses and the other  y kilograms of pulses, determine the number of steps required to get exactly z kilograms of pulses in one of the containers.
To start with, both containers are empty. The following operations are counted as 'steps':
emptying a container,
filling a container,
Transferring pulses from one container to the other, without spilling, until one of the containers is either full or empty.
Input
An int k, 1<=k<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by k sets of input data, each consisting of three positive integers x, y, z, not greater than 40000, given in separate lines.
Output
For each set of input data, output the minimum number of steps required to obtain z kilograms, or -1 if this is impossible.
